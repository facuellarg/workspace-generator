# Generate Workspace Golang Extension for VSCode

The "Generate Workspace Golang" extension for Visual Studio Code automates the process of setting up a new workspace tailored specifically for Golang developers. By scanning the current folder for Golang projects, it intelligently adds any detected projects into a single, convenient workspace. This is ideal for developers looking to streamline their setup process and quickly get started with their Golang projects in VSCode.

## Features

- **Automatic Golang Project Detection**: Scans the current folder for signs of Golang projects, specifically looking for `go.mod` files or `main.go` files. This ensures that only relevant Golang projects are added to the workspace.
- **Workspace Generation**: Generates a new workspace in the current folder, seamlessly integrating all detected Golang projects. This creates an organized environment that's ready for development.
- **Simplicity**: With just one command, set up your entire Golang development environment in VSCode, avoiding the hassle of manually adding projects to your workspace.

## How to Use

1. **Open the Command Palette** in VSCode by pressing `Ctrl+Shift+P` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Shift+P` (macOS).
2. **Type and select**: `Generate Workspace Golang`. The extension will start scanning the current folder for Golang projects.
3. **Wait for the process to complete**. Once done, your new workspace will be ready, with all discovered Golang projects added.

## Installation

You can install the "Generate Workspace Golang" extension directly from the Visual Studio Code Marketplace. Search for "Generate Workspace Golang" in the Extensions view (`Ctrl+Shift+X` / `Cmd+Shift+X`) and click on the install button.
